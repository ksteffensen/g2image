	<h2>WordPress Users STOP!!!</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>WordPress Users should install WPG2 3.0.5, which includes G2Image in it's entirety.
		See <a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/index.php?title=WordPress">
		this note</a> for a longer explanation.
		<li>G2Image 3.0.3 is not backwards compatible with WPG2 2.3 or earlier.
	</ul>

	<h3>I - REQUIREMENTS</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>To use the "Gallery 2 Image Chooser" plugin, you must have <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/" >Gallery2</a>
		installed and properly configured:
		<ul>
			<li>You must have <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php?title=Gallery2:Download">Gallery2 2.1.x or higher.</a>
			<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> This version WILL NOT WORK with Gallery2 version 2.0.x
		</ul>

		<li>The plugin was designed to be used with <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/" >TinyMCE.</a>
		<ul>
			<li>You must have TinyMCE version 3.0 or higher.
			<li>Tested with TinyMCE included with WordPress 2.5 and Joomla's JCE 1.5.0.
			<li>Tested with JCE 1.5.0 (includes TinyMCE) for Joomla.
		</ul>

		<li>The plugin was also designed to be used with <a href="http://www.fckeditor.net/" >FCKEditor.</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Tested with FCKEditor version 2.4.3 in WordPress and Drupal.</a>.
		</ul>

		<li>Finally, the plugin was also designed to be used in a standalone mode without a visual editor like TinyMCE or FCKEditor.
		<ul>
			<li>To use the plugin without TinyMCE (in an application other than WordPress), please see the
			<a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/index.php?title=Developers_Notes">G2Image Developers Notes Page</a>.
		</ul>

		<li>Tested with IE 7.0 and Firefox 2.0.

	</ol>

	<h3>II - INSTALLATION</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>Unzip the files.

		<li>Check config.php to make sure that $g2ic_gallery2_path is pointing to your Gallery2 directory.  ($g2ic_gallery2_path is relative to the server root, unless $g2ic_use_full_path is set to TRUE, in which case it is the full server path to Gallery2.)  If you are using
		an embedded application (other than WordPress) match the embedded paths, etc., at the bottom of config.php with the
		settings in your embedded application.

		<li>FTP the "g2image/" directory structure to a new folder called g2image in your TinyMCE or FCKEditor plugins directory.
		<ul>
			<li>If you are not using G2Image with TinyMCE or FCKEditor (as documented on the
			<a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/index.php?title=Developers_Notes">G2Image Developers Notes Page</a>),
			you can install the /g2image/ directory wherever it makes the most sense for your installation.
		</ul>

		<li>Please see the appropriate online page for platform-specific installation information.
		(This information changes more frequently than this README file is updated.  The list is alphabetical,
		not a suggested order of preference.)

		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/index.php?title=Drupal">Drupal</a>
		<li><a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/index.php?title=Joomla">Joomla!</a>
		<li><a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/index.php?title=WordPress">WordPress</a>
		<li><a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/index.php?title=FCKEditor">FCKEditor</a>
		<li><a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/index.php?title=Other_Platforms">Other Platforms</a>
		</ul>
		</ul>

		<li><strong>After everything is installed, force a reload (for FireFox) or a refresh
		(for IE).</strong>  This forces the TinyMCE javascript to reload and display the button.

		<li>There are several options that you can set in config.php, such as default
		view, default number of images, default class, and more.  There are notes for each
		configuration option in the config.php file.

		<li>CSS for the alignment options:

		<ul>
			<li>If you want to use the built-in alignment options, you'll need to add these
			three classes to your CSS.  You can also add upto four custom classes and add
			them to the config.php file.  Custom classes will be available in the alignment
			selector.

			<li>You'll need to customize these to fit into your site design.  This is how
			they're implemented in the CSS for www.steffensenfamily.com:

			<div class="codeblock" >
<pre>
.g2image_normal
{
	margin: 4px;
}

.g2image_float_left
{
	float: left;
	clear: left;
	margin: 4px;
}

.g2image_float_right
{
	float: right;
	clear: right;
	margin: 4px;
}

.g2image_centered
{
	display: block;
	margin-left: auto;
	margin-right: auto;
	text-align: center;
}
</pre>
			</div>

			<li>Note: The alignment classes only apply to HTML thumbnails, WPG2/WPG2ID tags, and
			Drupal G2 Filter tags - not the text links.
		</ul>

		<li>Language Support:
		<ul>
			<li>Version 3.0.1 shipped with support for de, en, es, fr, hu, it, ko, nb, nl, pl, zh_TW.
			<li>Set your language by changing $g2ic_language in config.php.
			<li>For information on updating existing translations or creating new translations, please
			see the <a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/index.php?title=Internationalization/Languages_Page">
			G2Image Internationalization Page</a>.

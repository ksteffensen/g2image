<h3>I - REQUIREMENTS</h3>

<ol>
<li>To use the "Gallery 2 Image Chooser" plugin, you must have <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/" >Gallery2</a>
installed and properly configured:
<ul>
<li>You must have <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php?title=Gallery2:Download&oldid=5932">Gallery2 2.0.x</a>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> This version WILL NOT WORK with Gallery2 version 2.1 or greater.
<ul>
<li>Use version 2.0 of the plugin if you need to use Gallery2 versions 2.1 or greater.
</ul>
<li><strong>You must also have the Gallery2 ImageBlock module installed and activated.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The ImageBlock module does not come with the "minimum" Gallery2 installation and must be downloaded from the <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php?title=Gallery2:Download&oldid=5932">Gallery2 download page</a> and installed separately.
</ul>
</ul>

<li>The plugin was designed to be used with <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/" >TinyMCE</a>
<ul>
<li>Tested with TinyMCE version 2.0.1 and with the modified TinyMCE that is included with WordPress 2.0
<li>To use the plugin without TinyMCE (in an application other than WordPress), please see the developer
documentation at <a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/">http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/</a>.
</ul>

<li>The plugin has been optimized for use with WordPress (with the WPG2 plugin):

<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/" >WordPress</a>
<ul>
<li>Tested with version 2.0.1.  (It should work well on version 1.5.2, but has not been thoroughly tested
on 1.5.2.)
</ul>
<li><a href="http://wpg2.ozgreg.com/" >WPG2</a>
<ul>
<li>Tested with version 1.0
</ul>
</ul>

<li>If you are using WP 2.0, and you have users in the "Author" role, you'll need
this plugin:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://redalt.com/wiki/Role+Manager" >Roles Mangager</a>
<ul>
<li>Activate it and modify the Author role by giving "Unfiltered HTML" rights.
</ul>
</ul>

<li>Tested with IE 6.0 and Firefox 1.5.
</ol>

<h3>II - INSTALLATION</h3>

<ol>
<li>Unzip the files.

<li>If you are NOT using WordPress with the WPG2 plugin, check config.php to
make sure that $g2ic_gallery2_path is pointing to your Gallery2 directory.  If you are using an embedded
application (other than WordPress) match the embedded paths, etc., at the bottom of config.php with the
settings in your embedded application.

<li>FTP the contents of the "tinymce_plugin/g2image/" directory to a new folder called /g2image/
in your TinyMCE plugins directory.
<ul>
<li>For WordPress 2.0, this is /wordpress/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/.
<li>If you are using TinyMCE version 2.0.3 or greater, overwrite /g2image/editor_plugin.js and
/g2image/editor_plugin_src.js with the files in the /TinyMCE_version_2.0.3_files/ directory.
</ul>

<li>If you are using WordPress, FTP the contents of the "wordpress_plugin/g2image/" directory to
a new folder called /g2image/ in your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
<ul>
<li>Then activate the plugin.  The G2Image options panel will appear under the overall
"Options" admin panel.
<li>If you previously installed a modified WP 2.0.x tiny_mce_gzip.php file for an earlier g2image
version, you should revert to the original WP 2.0.2 (or higher) tiny_mce_gzip.php file.
<ul>
<li>A copy of tiny_php_gzip.php from WP 2.0.2 is included in the wordpress_plugin/original_tiny_mce_gzip
directory.  The changes that were in the modified tiny_mce_gzip.php are now included in the WP 2.0.2 file.
<li>If you do not replace the previous tiny_mce_gzip.php file, the program will function properly, but you will
have two g2image buttons.
</ul>
<li>If you are using any other plugins that affect the TinyMCE button layout, like the Advanced Editor Plugin,
you need to check whether you'll need to add g2image to their button setup.
</ul>

<li>If you are not using WordPress 2.0 with WPG2, see the <a href="http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com/">
G2Image Information Homepage</a> for more info on getting G2Image to work with your application.

<ul>
<li>Basically, you'll need to find the file that is initializing
		TinyMCE for your installation.  It should have a tinyMCE.init
		function like the one below (but probably much more
		complicated).  You'll need to add g2image to the plugins and
		buttons areas:
<div class="codeblock" >
<pre>
tinyMCE.init({
      theme : "advanced",
      mode : "textareas",
      plugins : "g2image",
      theme_advanced_buttons3_add : "g2image"
});
</pre>
</div>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>CSS for the alignment options:

<ul>
<li>If you want to use the built-in alignment options, you'll need to add these
three classes to your CSS.  You can also add upto four custom classes and add
them to the config.php file.  Custom classes will be available in the alignment
selector.

<li>You'll need to customize these to fit into your site design.  This is how
they're implemented in the CSS for www.steffensenfamily.com:

<div class="codeblock" >
<pre>
.g2image_normal
{
	margin: 4px;
}

.g2image_float_left
{
	float: left;
	clear: left;
	margin: 4px;
}

.g2image_float_right
{
	float: right;
	clear: right;
	margin: 4px;
}

.g2image_centered
{
	display: block;
	margin-left: auto;
	margin-right: auto;
	text-align: center;
}
</pre>
</div>

<li>Note: The alignment classes only apply to the HTML thumbnails and the WPG2 tags,
not the text links.  If you use the g2image classes for your WPG2 tags, you
should not use the class for the WPG2 tags in the WordPress admin page for WPG2.
If you do, you'll end up with two &lt;div class=___&gt; tags competing against each
other.
</ul>

<li>After everything is installed, force a reload (for FireFox) or a refresh
(for IE).  This forces the TinyMCE javascript to reload and display the button.

<li>There are several options that you can set in config.php, such as default
view, default number of images, default class, and more.  There are notes for each
configuration option in the config.php file.

<li>Language Support:
<ul>
<li>Version 1.3 shipped with support for English (en), Chinese Traditional (zh_TW),
and Italian (it).
<li>If you translate /g2image/langs/en.js and en.php, you can use them by changing
the language settings in /g2image/config.php and editor_plugin.js.
<ul>
<li>For /g2image/config.php, set $g2ic_language to the corresponding letters.
<li>For /g2image/editor_plugin.php add your language to the
second line with a preceding comma after the "it".  For example German (de) is added here:
<ul>
<li><code>tinyMCE.importPluginLanguagePack('g2image', 'en, zh_TW, it, de');</code>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>For WordPress: If you use <a href="http://www.poedit.org/index.php">poEdit</a>
to create po and mo files from wp-content/plugins/g2image/locale/g2image.pot you
can localize the WordPress G2Image Admin panel.  Place the resulting g2image-xx.mo
file in the /locale/ folder (where xx is the locale language).  It should be the
same language and encoding as your WPLANG in wp-config.php.
<ul>
<li>Version 1.3.1 shipped with support for Chinese Traditional (g2image-zh_TW.mo)
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>

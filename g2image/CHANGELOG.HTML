<h3>Changelog</h3>

<p><strong>Version 3.1 - Under Development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Show best-sized resize (if available, instead of just fullsize) using the "magnifier" icon in the G2Image window.</li>
<li>Lots more to copy from G2Image website... from Windows Explorer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 3.0.3 - Under development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated TinyMCE API calls to TMCE version 3.0.x calls.</li>
<li>Changed to Slimbox script to get Lightbox functionality.  Same functions, but smaller download.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 3.0.2 - Released 10/05/07</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where WPG2 tags and Drupal G2 Filter tags for individual images failed if G2 ImageBlock version was older than 1.0.9.  Now degrades gracefully.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 3.0.1 - Released 09/26/07</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated prototype.js, scriptalicious.js, and effects.js to most recent versions.  This allows the plugin and LightBox to function correctly on Safari and Opera.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the custom alignment classes were not transferred from the WPG2 G2Image options tab to G2Image.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Chinese Traditional translation was not working on some servers.</li>
<li>Changed to use full URLs instead of server-relative URLs so that blog entries will display images in web-based RSS aggregators.</li>
<li>Updated the Italian, Polish, and Chinese Traditional translations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 3.0 - Released 09/16/07</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GUI reorganization.
<ul>
<li>Visual directory tree instead of breadcrumbs</li>
<li>Insertion options on a fixed pane to the side</li>
<li>Ability to select multiple images for insertion with the current insertion options</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Switched from php array method of internationalization to the standard gettext method.</li>
<li>Improved LightBox HTML tag by adding a variable slideshow group name (In 2.2.2 it defaulted to g2image)</li>
<li>Added support for the WPG2 tag "size" attribute. (Images only, not albums, because Gallery2 only stores a thumbnail for the album highlight, not resizes)</li>
<li>Added support for the Drupal G2 Filter tag "exactsize" attribute.  (Images only, not albums.)</li>
<li>Added "All" as a "thumbnails per page" option.</li>
<li>An added benefit of reorganizing the backend in v3.0 is that G2Image now fully honors Gallery2 user permissions.  It picks up the current user's permissions from the Gallery2 session cookie and applies them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 2.2.2 - Released 8/26/07</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where thumbnail and fullsized image URLs were incorrect if the Gallery2 directory was not /gallery2/</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 2.2.1 - Released 8/25/07</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enabled use with Gallery2 v2.1.x by improving the method for finding the root album (allows for use of the better method in G2 2.2, but still allows use with G2 2.1).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 2.2 - Released 8/24/07</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminated use of G2 ImageBlock call in the backend.  This eases getting information about a Gallery2 item.</li>
<li>Updated the Album selection so that it loads all albums in a tree and automatically reload the page on album selection.</li>
<li>Added support for a LightBox HTML tag and fullsized image HTML tags.</li>
<li>Added FCKEditor integration.</li>

requiring another button press.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 2.1 - Released only for WPG2 2.1 - Changes included in 2.2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated WPG2 support for WP 2.1 with TinyMCE plugins in the WP plugin directory</li>
